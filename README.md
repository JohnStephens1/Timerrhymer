## Introduction

## How to Install

Simply download `Timerrhymer.exe` from the _Releases_ section, and you're good to go! No installation required, not even Python.

The first time running the `.exe` file you might get a warning saying that the app isn't recognized, but after clicking 'More Info' and 'Run anyway' the warning shouldn't pop up anymore.

The only way to get rid of the warning would require me to buy a yearly subscription costing hundreds of euros, and since this is free, open-source software, that isn't in the cards for now.

Alternatively, if you prefer to use Python to run the program instead, clone the repository and run main.py using a Python environment containing the packages listed in requirements.txt, which can simply be installed by running:

```batch
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
